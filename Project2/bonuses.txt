BONUS CHALLENGE FORM
--------------------

For each bonus challenge you have implemented, please replace the sentence "We are not entitled to this bonus."
with a short description of:

1. How it was implemented in your code
2. Where it was used (in which class methods).
3. How you tested that it is working correctly.

--------------------

1. Fully supporting all configuration fields and avoiding the use of magic numbers

1.1) We have supported the config's fields, and also we have avoided the use of magic numbers by using the configs' fields, and implemented varibles and using them as final static. 
1.2) Used configs in the timer that the dealer used, for example we have used point/penalty/timeout fields in the config in updateTimerDisplay in 
    timeLoop. In addition, we used static final to limit the size of the tokens of the players' tokensQueue legalSetSize, called it with Table.legalSetSize.
1.3) The complier runs it softly :), and the run limits the fields and the display works with configs' fields. 


2. Terminating all threads (that you created) gracefully and in reverse order to the order they were created in.

2.1) Terminating all the threads in reverse order by calling the terminate() function in the reverse order of the array, from the length to 0
    then calling each Thread join so it will finish by the order.

3. Handling the config.turnTimeoutMillis value as follows:
config.turnTimeoutMillis < 0: display nothing.
config.turnTimeoutMillis = 0: display a timer since the last action (reshuffle or set collected).
Note: in modes without a countdown timer the dealer must ensure there is always at least one legal set on the table.

We are not entitled to this bonus.

4. Making sure that the threads do not wake up unless some actual job needs to be done (e.g., a value needs to be
changed on the display, key input needs to be handled, etc.) and the only threads created by you are:
1 thread per player + 1 additional thread for non-human players.

1) We have not used more than the threads you requested, 1 for each player for human, 2 for non-Human.
2) each player that has nothing to do, was waiting in the monitor he was given order by notify, then he gets to do something.
