The world cup is upon us, and you want to stay updated. Thus, in this project,
implementing a ”community-led” world cup update subscription
service. 

Users can subscribe to a game channel and report and receive reports about the game to and from the other subscribed users.

For the above-mentioned purpose, the code will include the implementation for both a server, which will provide STOMP server services and a client.
Client which a user can use in order to interact with the rest of the users. 

The server will be implemented in Java and will support both Thread-Per-Client (TPC) and the Reactor, choosing which one according to arguments given on startup. 

The client will be implemented in C++ and will hold the required logic as described below.

All communication between the clients and the server will be according to
STOMP ‘Simple-Text-Oriented-Messaging-Protocol’.
